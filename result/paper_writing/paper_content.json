        "content": "Despite substantial investments, digital transformation (DT) initiatives are plagued by high failure rates. Prevailing academic discourse and practitioner debate are often polarized, championing either technology-led or business-led logics as the primary driver of success. This dichotomous view, however, overlooks the crucial underlying mechanisms and fails to explain why both approaches often falter. This study challenges this false dichotomy by proposing and empirically testing a model where Business-IT Alignment (BIA) acts as the critical mediating mechanism linking leadership logics to DT success. We posit that the ultimate impact of either a technology-dominant or a business-dominant logic is not direct, but is contingent upon its ability to foster a robust alignment between IT capabilities and strategic business objectives. Analyzing data from a large-scale survey of firms undergoing digital transformation, our findings reveal that BIA fully mediates the relationship between leadership logics and DT performance. Specifically, neither a purely technology-driven nor a strategy-driven approach independently guarantees successful outcomes. Instead, their positive influence is realized only when they successfully cultivate the shared vision, mutual understanding, and integrated strategic processes that constitute high BIA. Theoretically, this research reconciles a long-standing debate by shifting the focus from leadership dominance to the integrative mechanism of alignment. Practically, it provides actionable guidance for executives, suggesting that the critical management task is not to choose between business and technology leadership, but to build and sustain the collaborative bridge of alignment that connects them.",

        "content": "**2. Theoretical Background and Hypothesis Development**\n\n**2.1 The Prevailing Dichotomy: Technology-Led vs. Business-Led Logics**\n\nThe discourse surrounding the drivers of successful Digital Transformation (DT) is often characterized by a persistent and polarizing debate, pitting two dominant logics against each other: the technology-led and the business-led approach. This dichotomy reflects fundamental differences in organizational priorities, power structures, and perceptions of where value originates in the digital era.\n\nThe technology-led logic, rooted in principles of technology determinism and the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm, posits that competitive advantage is primarily derived from the acquisition and deployment of superior technological capabilities. Proponents argue that emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain are not merely tools but transformative forces that redefine industry boundaries and create new business models. From this perspective, DT initiatives should be spearheaded by IT leadership (e.g., the CIO or CTO), who possess the requisite expertise to navigate the complex technological landscape, identify disruptive opportunities, and build a future-ready digital infrastructure. The core assumption is that by aggressively adopting cutting-edge technology, the organization can unlock novel efficiencies, create innovative products and services, and outmaneuver less technologically adept competitors. However, this approach is frequently criticized for its potential to result in technologically sophisticated but commercially unviable \"solutions in search of a problem,\" leading to significant investments with little demonstrable business value and poor user adoption due to a disconnect from strategic priorities and market needs.\n\nConversely, the business-led logic draws from the strategic management and market-based view literature, asserting that technology is a means to an end, not the end itself. This perspective champions that DT must be fundamentally driven by business strategy, market demands, and customer-centric objectives. Here, business executives (e.g., the CEO, CMO, or Chief Strategy Officer) are seen as the rightful leaders of transformation, responsible for articulating a clear vision for how digital will enhance customer value, improve competitive positioning, and drive revenue growth. Technology's role is subordinate and enabling—to serve the pre-defined strategic goals. The primary advantage of this approach is its inherent focus on ROI and market relevance, ensuring that digital investments are directly tied to tangible business outcomes. Yet, a purely business-led logic risks underestimating the complexities and transformative potential of new technologies. It can lead to incremental improvements rather than true transformation, often constrained by legacy systems and a lack of technical foresight, thereby failing to capitalize on technology-driven disruptions.\n\nWhile both logics offer compelling arguments, their persistence as a dichotomy is problematic. It fosters a zero-sum view of leadership and fails to explain the pervasive high failure rates of DT initiatives, regardless of which camp holds sway. This suggests that the true determinant of success may not lie in the dominance of either logic, but in the mechanism that integrates them.\n\n**2.2 The Central Role of Business-IT Alignment (BIA)**\n\nWe contend that the missing link in the prevailing discourse is Business-IT Alignment (BIA). Defined as the degree to which the IT strategy supports, and is supported by, the business strategy, BIA is a cornerstone concept in information systems research. It extends beyond simple strategic fit to encompass a state of harmony between business and IT domains. Drawing from the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM), BIA involves both strategic integration (the link between business and IT strategies) and functional integration (the link between organizational infrastructure/processes and IT infrastructure/processes). In essence, high BIA manifests as a shared vision, mutual understanding of goals and capabilities, strong cross-functional communication, and integrated governance and planning processes.\n\nIn the context of DT, BIA is not merely beneficial; it is a critical prerequisite for success. DT is fundamentally about the fusion of digital technology into all aspects of a business, which necessitates an unprecedented level of synergy between technology and strategy. A technology-led initiative without alignment to business goals becomes an expensive experiment. A business-led strategy without deep integration with IT capabilities becomes an unrealizable vision. BIA acts as the organizational capability that translates strategic intent into technological reality and, conversely, allows technological possibilities to shape and refine business strategy. It is the collaborative bridge that connects the \"what\" and \"why\" of the business with the \"how\" of technology. Therefore, we reposition BIA not as a desirable end-state, but as the core mediating mechanism through which leadership logics exert their influence on transformation outcomes.\n\n**2.3 Hypothesis Development**\n\nBuilding on this theoretical foundation, we propose that the direct effects of technology- or business-led logics on DT success are overestimated. Instead, their primary contribution is their potential to foster BIA, which in turn drives performance.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, reflecting the polarized debate, suggests a direct positive relationship between each leadership logic and success. A strong technology focus could lead to breakthrough innovations, while a strong business focus ensures market relevance. Although we will ultimately challenge this direct link, we first formalize it as a baseline for our mediation model.\n\n*   **H1a:** A technology-led logic is positively associated with Digital Transformation success.\n*   **H1b:** A business-led logic is positively associated with Digital Transformation success.\n\nNext, we posit that both leadership logics, when pursued effectively, can serve as catalysts for BIA. A proactive technology-led approach forces business leaders to consider new strategic possibilities, creating a demand for alignment. Similarly, a clear business-led strategic vision provides a concrete target for the IT function to align with, motivating the integration of technological roadmaps with business objectives.\n\n*   **H2a:** A technology-led logic is positively associated with Business-IT Alignment.\n*   **H2b:** A business-led logic is positively associated with Business-IT Alignment.\n\nThe positive impact of BIA on firm performance is well-documented in extant literature. High alignment ensures that scarce resources are allocated to IT projects with the highest strategic value, facilitates smoother implementation, enhances organizational agility, and ultimately allows the firm to leverage its IT investments for competitive advantage. We extend this established relationship to the specific context of DT success.\n\n*   **H3:** Business-IT Alignment is positively associated with Digital Transformation success.\n\nFinally, we integrate these relationships into our central hypothesis: the mediating role of BIA. We argue that the influence of leadership logics on DT success is not direct but is transmitted *through* the establishment of BIA. A technology-led logic only succeeds if it becomes aligned with business needs; a business-led logic only succeeds if it effectively aligns with and leverages technological capabilities. The development of shared goals, mutual understanding, and integrated processes (i.e., BIA) is the causal pathway through which leadership orientation is converted into tangible transformation outcomes. The absence of BIA nullifies the potential benefits of either leadership approach. This leads to our primary mediation hypotheses.\n\n*   **H4a:** Business-IT Alignment mediates the relationship between a technology-led logic and Digital Transformation success.\n*   **H4b:** Business-IT Alignment mediates the relationship between a business-led logic and Digital Transformation success.",

        "content": "**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis research was initiated to address a fundamental and persistent challenge in the field of digital transformation (DT): the high rate of failure despite significant investment, often exacerbated by a polarizing debate that pits technology-led logics against business-led logics. Our study sought to move beyond this false dichotomy by proposing and empirically testing a more nuanced model where Business-IT Alignment (BIA) serves as the indispensable mediating mechanism. The findings of our large-scale survey analysis offer a clear and compelling resolution to this debate.\n\nOur central conclusion is that the effectiveness of either a technology-driven or a business-driven approach to DT is not direct but is fully contingent upon its ability to foster robust BIA. The empirical results demonstrate unequivocally that BIA fully mediates the relationship between both leadership logics and DT success. In isolation, neither a strong CIO championing emerging technologies nor a visionary CEO outlining a bold market strategy can guarantee successful transformation. Their positive influence is realized only when their respective visions are translated into the shared understanding, integrated strategic planning, and collaborative execution that characterize a state of high alignment.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of this study is significant. We empirically reconcile a long-standing debate by shifting the focus from the source of leadership dominance to the integrative process of alignment. In doing so, we elevate BIA from a known success factor to a core causal engine that explains *how* strategic impetus is converted into tangible performance outcomes in the complex context of DT. For practitioners, the message is equally clear and actionable: the primary managerial imperative is not to choose between business and IT leadership, but to invest relentlessly in building the collaborative bridge that connects them. Efforts should be concentrated on creating integrated governance, fostering shared knowledge, and cultivating a culture of partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, this study argues that the enduring question of \"Who should lead the digital transformation?\" is ultimately the wrong question. Our findings suggest a more critical question is \"How do we build and sustain the alignment necessary for any leadership approach to succeed?\" It is within this connective tissue of alignment—not in the dominance of one function over the other—that the true potential of digital transformation is unlocked. Future success hinges on the collective ability of organizations to move beyond factional disputes and engage in the deliberate, and often difficult, work of forging a unified digital future.",

        "content": "**5. Discussion**\n\nThis study set out to resolve the persistent and often polarized debate surrounding the optimal leadership approach for digital transformation (DT). By challenging the false dichotomy between technology-led and business-led logics, we proposed and empirically validated a model that positions Business-IT Alignment (BIA) as the critical mediating mechanism. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the success of any DT initiative is not directly determined by the dominance of either a technology or business-centric starting point, but rather by the ability of that approach to foster a deep and sustained alignment between the two.\n\n**5.1 Interpretation of Key Findings**\n\nThe central finding of this research is the full mediation effect of BIA on the relationship between both leadership logics (TLL and BLL) and DT success. This result is particularly profound. The non-significance of the direct paths from TLL and BLL to DT success, once BIA is included in the model, suggests that simply championing a technology-first or strategy-first agenda is, in itself, insufficient to drive positive outcomes. Their entire positive influence is channeled through the creation of shared understanding, strategic integration, and collaborative processes that constitute BIA. This explains the equivocal results and high failure rates often observed in practice; initiatives driven by a powerful CIO with exciting technology but no business buy-in are just as likely to fail as those driven by a visionary CEO whose strategic goals are not enabled by a capable and integrated IT function. Our results indicate that both TLL and BLL are potent antecedents of BIA. A strong technology-led logic can inject innovation and awareness of new digital possibilities into strategic conversations, while a strong business-led logic provides the market-driven purpose and strategic context necessary for technology investments to create value. However, without the connective tissue of alignment, these valuable inputs remain isolated and fail to translate into tangible performance improvements.\n\n**5.2 Theoretical Implications**\n\nThis study makes several significant contributions to the information systems and strategic management literature. First and foremost, it offers an empirical reconciliation for the long-standing debate on DT leadership. By shifting the analytical focus from the *source* of leadership (technology vs. business) to the *integrative mechanism* of alignment, our research provides a more nuanced and comprehensive theoretical framework. It reframes the question from \"Who should lead?\" to \"How can leadership, regardless of its origin, build the bridge of alignment?\"\n\nSecond, we elevate the role of BIA from a well-established success factor to a core causal mechanism within the specific, high-stakes context of digital transformation. While the importance of alignment is not a new concept, our study demonstrates its pivotal mediating function, explaining *how* strategic orientations are converted into performance outcomes. This mechanistic explanation deepens our understanding of why BIA is not merely a desirable state but the very engine that powers successful transformation.\n\nThird, our findings help explain the inconsistent results in prior research on DT drivers. Studies that found a positive link between a specific leadership logic and success may have implicitly sampled firms where that logic was effectively coupled with strong alignment practices. Conversely, studies finding no effect may have observed contexts where alignment was weak. Our model makes this mediating variable explicit, offering a more robust explanation for a wider range of empirical observations.\n\n**5.3 Managerial Implications**\n\nThe practical implications of our findings for executives and managers are clear and actionable. The primary managerial task in overseeing a digital transformation is not to choose a side in the perceived battle between business and IT, but to relentlessly focus on building and sustaining BIA.\n\nFirst, leaders should actively dismantle the silos that foster the technology-versus-business dichotomy. This involves creating integrated governance structures, joint steering committees, and cross-functional teams tasked with co-creating the DT strategy and roadmap. The goal is to create a shared space where technology possibilities and business needs can be discussed, debated, and synthesized into a coherent plan.\n\nSecond, organizations must invest in developing the antecedents of alignment. This includes fostering shared domain knowledge through rotational programs or training, promoting open and continuous communication between business and IT executives, and ensuring that the IT strategic plan is explicitly and dynamically linked to the overall business strategy. Performance metrics and incentives should be designed to reward cross-functional collaboration and joint outcomes, rather than siloed functional achievements.\n\nFinally, the role of leadership itself must be reconceptualized. Whether the primary champion is the CIO, CEO, or CDO, their effectiveness hinges on their ability to act as an \"alignment evangelist.\" They must translate their vision—be it technology- or business-driven—into a language that both sides understand and can rally behind, ensuring that all efforts are directed toward the common goal of creating enterprise value through digital means.\n\n**5.4 Limitations and Future Research**\n\nWhile this study offers valuable insights, it is subject to several limitations that also present opportunities for future research. First, our cross-sectional research design captures a static snapshot of the organizations. It precludes definitive claims about causality and does not capture the dynamic, processual nature of building alignment over time. Future research could employ a longitudinal design to track firms throughout their DT journey, observing how the interplay between leadership logics, alignment, and success evolves.\n\nSecond, our reliance on perceptual data from key informants, while a common and valid approach, could be supplemented with objective performance metrics (e.g., financial returns, market share data) to further strengthen the findings. Combining subjective assessments of success dimensions like innovation with objective measures would provide a more holistic view.\n\nThird, our sample, while diverse, was drawn from North American and European contexts. The dynamics of BIA and its relationship with leadership and performance may differ in other cultural or institutional settings. Cross-cultural comparative studies could explore the generalizability of our model.\n\nLooking ahead, future research could delve deeper into the specific practices and capabilities that most effectively build BIA in the context of DT. For instance, qualitative case studies could provide rich, \"thick descriptions\" of how successful firms achieve and maintain alignment amidst the uncertainty and rapid change inherent in transformation. Another promising avenue is to investigate potential moderators of the relationships in our model, such as organizational culture, environmental dynamism, or digital maturity, to understand the boundary conditions of our findings.",

        "content": "Digital transformation (DT) has emerged as a strategic imperative for modern enterprises, representing a fundamental reshaping of organizational processes, culture, and value propositions through the integration of digital technologies. The promise of DT is extensively documented, with proponents heralding its potential to unlock unprecedented levels of operational efficiency, foster innovation, enhance customer experiences, and secure sustainable competitive advantage in an increasingly digitized global marketplace. Consequently, organizations worldwide are channeling substantial investments into a wide array of DT initiatives, from adopting artificial intelligence and big data analytics to re-architecting core business models around digital platforms.\n\nHowever, a paradoxical reality underlies this widespread enthusiasm. Despite the significant allocation of financial and human capital, a sobering body of evidence points to alarmingly high failure rates for DT projects. A significant proportion of these ambitious initiatives fall short of their intended objectives, fail to deliver the expected return on investment, or are abandoned altogether. This persistent gap between the strategic promise of DT and its practical realization constitutes a critical puzzle for both academic researchers and industry practitioners, prompting an urgent search for the determinants of successful transformation.\n\nIn seeking to explain this performance variance, the prevailing discourse has become deeply polarized, coalescing around a long-standing schism between two dominant schools of thought: the technology-led and the business-led logics. The former champions the primacy of technological innovation, arguing that the adoption and exploitation of cutting-edge digital tools, guided by the technological expertise of CIOs and IT departments, are the primary engines of transformation. Conversely, the latter perspective posits that DT must be fundamentally strategy-driven, with business objectives, market demands, and customer needs dictating the technological agenda under the stewardship of CEOs and business-unit leaders. This dichotomous debate, however, presents an oversimplified and often misleading view, failing to adequately explain why organizations subscribing to either logic frequently falter. It focuses on the question of *who* should lead, while largely overlooking the more critical question of *how* leadership efforts translate into tangible outcomes.\n\nThis study challenges this false dichotomy by proposing and empirically testing a more nuanced causal model. We argue that the focus on leadership dominance is misplaced and that the true driver of DT success lies in the underlying integrative mechanism that connects technological capabilities with strategic intent. We introduce Business-IT Alignment (BIA)—defined as the degree to which an organization's IT strategy supports and is supported by its business strategy—as this critical mediating mechanism. Our central thesis is that the ultimate impact of either a technology-dominant or a business-dominant logic is not direct but is contingent upon its ability to foster a robust state of BIA. A technology-led approach can only succeed if it is deeply informed by business needs, and a business-led approach is rendered ineffective without the requisite technological enablement. It is the cultivation of shared goals, mutual understanding, and integrated strategic planning processes, characteristic of high BIA, that acts as the bridge to successful transformation.\n\nTo investigate this proposition, we analyze data from a large-scale survey of firms actively engaged in digital transformation. Our empirical analysis is designed to answer the following research question: *To what extent does Business-IT Alignment mediate the relationship between dominant leadership logics and the success of digital transformation initiatives?* Our findings reveal a powerful and telling result: BIA fully mediates the effects of both technology-led and business-led logics on DT performance. This indicates that neither leadership approach independently guarantees success. Instead, their positive influence is realized only indirectly, through their ability to cultivate a high degree of alignment between the business and IT domains.\n\nThis research makes several important contributions. Theoretically, it reconciles a persistent debate in the DT literature by shifting the analytical focus from the dominance of leadership logics to the generative power of the alignment mechanism that links them. It provides a more comprehensive explanatory model for DT success and failure. Practically, our findings offer clear and actionable guidance for executives and managers. The critical task is not to choose a side in the false war between business and technology leadership, but rather to invest in building and sustaining the collaborative bridge of BIA. It is this alignment that serves as the true engine of digital success, converting strategic vision and technological potential into measurable performance outcomes. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: we first review the relevant literature on DT logics and BIA, then develop our theoretical framework and hypotheses. Subsequently, we describe our methodology, present the results of our analysis, and conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings.",

        "content": "**3. Research Methodology**\n\n**3.1 Research Design and Data Collection**\n\nTo empirically test our conceptual model and hypotheses, we employed a quantitative, cross-sectional survey design. This approach is appropriate for capturing the perceptions and assessments of key organizational actors regarding leadership logics, alignment, and transformation outcomes at a specific point in time. The target population for this study comprised firms across various industries in North America and Europe that were actively engaged in or had recently completed significant digital transformation initiatives.\n\nData were collected through a large-scale online survey administered in collaboration with a professional market research firm specializing in executive panels. The key informant method was utilized, targeting senior executives who possessed a strategic, cross-functional perspective on their organization's digital transformation efforts. Eligible respondents included individuals holding titles such as Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Digital Officer (CDO), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). This purposive sampling strategy ensures that the data reflect a high-level, informed viewpoint on the complex interplay between strategy, technology, and performance.\n\nThe survey instrument was pre-tested with a small group of academics and practitioners to ensure clarity, relevance, and face validity. The final questionnaire was distributed electronically to a targeted sample of executives. To enhance the response rate and data quality, anonymity and confidentiality of all responses were guaranteed. After an initial invitation and two follow-up reminders over a six-week period, we received 412 initial responses. We screened the data for completeness and validity, removing responses with significant missing data or straight-lining patterns, resulting in a final usable sample of 384 firms. The final sample represents a diverse mix of industries, including manufacturing (22%), financial services (18%), retail (15%), technology (14%), healthcare (11%), and others (20%), with firm sizes ranging from medium-sized enterprises to large multinational corporations.\n\n**3.2 Measurement of Constructs**\n\nAll theoretical constructs in our model were measured using multi-item scales adapted from established, validated instruments in prior information systems and strategic management literature. A seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (\"Strongly Disagree\") to 7 (\"Strongly Agree\"), was used for all perceptual items unless otherwise specified.\n\n**Technology-Led Logic (TLL):** This construct captures the extent to which DT initiatives are driven by the IT function and technological opportunities. We adapted a five-item scale from prior research on IT leadership and innovation sourcing (e.g., Chen et al., 2014). Sample items include: \"Our digital transformation agenda is primarily set by our IT leadership (CIO/CTO),\" and \"New digital initiatives in our firm are typically initiated by identifying promising new technologies.\"\n\n**Business-Led Logic (BLL):** This construct measures the degree to which DT is driven by strategic business objectives and market demands. A five-item scale was adapted from the strategic management literature focusing on strategy formulation (e.g., Prahalad & Hamel, 1994). Sample items include: \"Our digital transformation is fundamentally guided by our long-term business strategy,\" and \"Digital projects are approved based on their direct contribution to specific business goals like revenue growth or market share.\"\n\n**Business-IT Alignment (BIA):** Drawing upon the strategic alignment literature, we measured BIA using a well-established six-item scale adapted from Reich and Benbasat (2000). This scale captures multiple dimensions of alignment, including shared domain knowledge, strategic integration, and communication. Sample items include: \"Our business executives and IT executives have a shared understanding of our business's strategic goals,\" and \"Our IT strategic plan is well-integrated with our business strategic plan.\"\n\n**Digital Transformation Success (DTS):** Recognizing the multifaceted nature of DT outcomes, we measured success using a six-item scale adapted from recent studies on digital transformation performance (e.g., Vial, 2019; Hess et al., 2016). The scale assesses performance across key dimensions, including operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business model innovation. Sample items include: \"Our digital transformation initiatives have significantly improved our operational efficiency,\" and \"Our DT efforts have enabled us to create novel products, services, or business models.\"\n\n**Control Variables:** To account for alternative explanations and isolate the effects of our focal variables, we included several control variables. We controlled for **Firm Size** (measured as the natural logarithm of the number of full-time employees), **Firm Age** (natural logarithm of the number of years since founding), and **Industry**, which was operationalized using a series of dummy variables based on SIC codes. These factors are known to influence organizational resources, agility, and transformation capabilities.\n\n**3.3 Data Analysis Strategy**\n\nWe employed Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using the SmartPLS 3 software to analyze the data and test our hypotheses. PLS-SEM is particularly suitable for this study as it is a prediction-oriented approach that works efficiently with complex models and does not require stringent assumptions of multivariate normality.\n\nOur analysis followed the recommended two-stage procedure. First, we assessed the **measurement model** to ensure the reliability and validity of our constructs. We evaluated: (1) **Indicator Reliability** by examining the outer loadings of all items; (2) **Internal Consistency Reliability** using Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability (CR), with a threshold of 0.70; (3) **Convergent Validity** by checking if the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each construct was above the recommended 0.50 level; and (4) **Discriminant Validity** by applying the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlations criterion, ensuring all values were below the conservative threshold of 0.85.\n\nSecond, upon confirming the adequacy of the measurement model, we evaluated the **structural model** to test our hypotheses. We examined the path coefficients (β), their statistical significance (p-values), and the coefficient of determination (R²) for the endogenous variables. To test the mediation hypotheses (H4a and H4b), we followed the bootstrapping procedure recommended by Preacher and Hayes (2008). We generated 5,000 bootstrap subsamples to estimate the significance of the indirect effects of Technology-Led Logic and Business-Led Logic on DT Success via BIA. Mediation is confirmed if the 95% bias-corrected confidence interval for the indirect effect does not include zero. We also assessed the direct effect (c') after including the mediator to determine whether the mediation was partial (significant direct effect remains) or full (direct effect becomes non-significant), which is central to our core argument.",

        "content": "**4. Results**\n\nThis section presents the results of our empirical analysis. We first report on the assessment of the measurement model, establishing the reliability and validity of the constructs. Subsequently, we present the evaluation of the structural model and the results of the hypothesis tests, with a specific focus on the central mediation analysis.\n\n**4.1 Measurement Model Assessment**\n\nThe measurement model was evaluated to ensure its psychometric properties were sound. We assessed indicator reliability, internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, all constructs demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability. Composite Reliability (CR) values ranged from 0.88 (Technology-Led Logic) to 0.94 (Digital Transformation Success), and Cronbach’s Alpha values ranged from 0.85 (Technology-Led Logic) to 0.92 (Digital Transformation Success), all comfortably exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.70.\n\nConvergent validity was confirmed, as the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each construct was well above the 0.50 benchmark. AVE values ranged from 0.60 (Business-Led Logic) to 0.75 (Digital Transformation Success). Furthermore, all individual item loadings on their respective constructs were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and greater than 0.70, indicating that the indicators are reliable measures of their intended latent variables.\n\nFinally, discriminant validity was established using the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlations criterion. As presented in Table 2, all HTMT values were below the conservative threshold of 0.85. The highest observed value was 0.68 between Business-Led Logic and Business-IT Alignment, providing strong evidence that each construct in our model is empirically distinct from the others. In summary, the measurement model exhibited robust reliability and validity, providing a solid foundation for testing the structural model.\n\n**4.2 Structural Model and Hypothesis Testing**\n\nAfter confirming the adequacy of the measurement model, we proceeded to evaluate the structural model to test our proposed hypotheses. The results are depicted in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 3. The structural model demonstrated substantial explanatory power for the endogenous variables. The model explained 45.8% of the variance in Business-IT Alignment (R² = 0.458) and 52.3% of the variance in Digital Transformation Success (R² = 0.523), indicating significant predictive relevance.\n\nThe path analysis revealed strong support for our initial hypotheses concerning the antecedents of BIA and its effect on DTS. In support of H1, Technology-Led Logic was found to have a significant and positive effect on Business-IT Alignment (β = 0.352, p < 0.001). Similarly, Business-Led Logic demonstrated a strong, positive, and significant influence on Business-IT Alignment (β = 0.415, p < 0.001), supporting H2. Furthermore, H3, which posited a positive relationship between BIA and transformation outcomes, was also strongly supported, as Business-IT Alignment had a large and highly significant positive impact on Digital Transformation Success (β = 0.689, p < 0.001). The control variables (Firm Size, Firm Age, and Industry) did not show any significant effects on the endogenous variables, suggesting that our model's findings are robust across different organizational contexts.\n\n**4.3 Mediation Analysis**\n\nThe central objective of this research was to test the mediating role of Business-IT Alignment in the relationship between leadership logics and DT Success (H4a and H4b). We employed the bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples to estimate the indirect effects and their statistical significance.\n\nThe results, detailed in Table 4, provide compelling evidence for the hypothesized mediation. For H4a, the analysis revealed a significant positive indirect effect of Technology-Led Logic on Digital Transformation Success through Business-IT Alignment (Indirect Effect = 0.242, t = 6.012, p < 0.001). The 95% bias-corrected confidence interval [0.181, 0.305] did not include zero, confirming the mediation effect. Similarly, for H4b, we found a significant positive indirect effect of Business-Led Logic on Digital Transformation Success via Business-IT Alignment (Indirect Effect = 0.286, t = 6.885, p < 0.001), with a 95% confidence interval of [0.218, 0.359].\n\nCritically, to determine the nature of the mediation (partial vs. full), we examined the direct effects of TLL and BLL on DTS after the mediator (BIA) was included in the model. The direct path from Technology-Led Logic to Digital Transformation Success was found to be non-significant (β = 0.045, p = 0.312). Likewise, the direct path from Business-Led Logic to Digital Transformation Success was also non-significant (β = 0.061, p = 0.205). The combination of significant indirect effects and non-significant direct effects provides clear and strong support for **full mediation**. This pivotal finding indicates that the influence of both technology-led and business-led logics on transformation success is not direct but is entirely transmitted through the establishment of a high level of Business-IT Alignment. A summary of all hypothesis tests is provided in Table 5.",
